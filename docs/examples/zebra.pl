% Zebra puzzle, adapted from Eyelet's input/zebra.pl.
%
% Five houses are represented as house(Color, Nationality, Pet, Beverage,
% Cigarette).  Each clue is a member/2, first/2, third/2, next_to/3, or adjacent/3
% constraint over that list.  The answer is the classic one: the Norwegian drinks
% water and the Japanese owns the zebra.

% Output declarations: host-supplied goals select the relations written to this example's golden output.
%% goal: waterDrinker(X0, X1)

%% goal: zebraOwner(X0, X1)

%% goal: solved(X0, X1)


% The single zebra/2 rule is a finite constraint model over the five house slots.
