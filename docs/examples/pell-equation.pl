% Pell equation x^2 - 2y^2 = 1 by automatically tabled recurrence.
%
% The fundamental solution (3,2) induces a linear recurrence for all positive
% solutions of x^2 - 2y^2 = 1.  The example querys later solutions and also
% rechecks the Diophantine identity so the generated sequence is auditable.
%% goal: pell_answer(X0, X1)



% N=0 is the neutral solution; each recursive step multiplies by 3 + 2*sqrt(2).
pell(0, 1, 0).
pell(N, X, Y) :-
  (N > 0),
  (N1 is N - 1),
  pell(N1, X0, Y0),

  (By is 4 * Y0),
  (X is Ax + By),

  (Y is Cx + Dy).

% Verification is intentionally independent of the recurrence equations above.
