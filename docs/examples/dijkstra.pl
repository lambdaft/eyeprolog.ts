% Weighted path enumeration adapted from Eyeling dijkstra.n3.
%
% The Eyeling source uses collect/sort built-ins for Dijkstra's queue.  This
% eyeprolog variant enumerates simple paths, keeps the bounded frontier shown in
% the Eyeling output for a -> f, and scopes the graph inside a quoted term so the
% route network is not asserted as ambient edge facts.

% Output declarations: host-supplied goals select the relations written to this example's golden output.
%% goal: edge(X0, X1)

%% goal: path(X0, X1)


% The weighted graph stays inside weighted_graph/2; base_link/3 projects only
% the scoped edges needed by this example before the undirected link/3 view is built.
