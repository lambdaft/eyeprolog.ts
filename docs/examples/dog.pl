% Dog-license compliance rule adapted from Eyeling dog.n3.
%
% hasDog/2 records individual dogs.  dogCount/2 uses countall/2 to aggregate all
% dogs per subject, and mustHave/2 derives the license obligation exactly for
% subjects with more than four registered dogs.
%
% The example is intentionally tiny but useful as an aggregate-counting pattern.
