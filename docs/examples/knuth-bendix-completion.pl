% Bounded Knuth-Bendix-style completion for append/2 terms.
%
% Full Knuth-Bendix completion orients equations, generates all critical pairs,
% reduces them, and may add new rules until all overlaps are joinable.  That is
% a difficult global search problem.  This example keeps the recognizable shape
% but bounds the hard part: the rewrite system is fixed, and a small catalog of
% critical overlaps is checked for joinability by normalization.
