% Blocks-world planning without cut.
%
% A finite-depth planner searches for a five-move plan over five blocks.  States
% are sorted lists of on(Block, Support) facts so equality and visited-state
% checks are purely structural.

% Output declarations: host-supplied goals select the relations written to this example's golden output.
%% goal: status(X0, X1)

%% goal: plan(X0, X1)

%% goal: finalState(X0, X1)

%% goal: blockCount(X0, X1)


% The initial and goal states are lists of on/2 facts.  Sorting successor states
% gives canonical terms for equality and visited-state checks.
