% Bulk character-by-character writes to a non-console text stream.
%
% put_char/2 writes one character at a time to an open file stream, and each
% write logically appends at the current stream position (ISO 7.10.2.8). This
% is the common pattern for hand-rolled serializers that emit one character or
% code point per call rather than a single bulk write/1 call. The example
% writes a repeating a-z run to a temporary file, closes it, then reopens and
% reads the file back one character at a time with get_char/2 to confirm every
% character round-trips. The path is under /tmp so the source tree is
% unchanged.
