% Wolf, goat and cabbage puzzle, adapted from Eyelet's
% input/wolf-goat-cabbage.pl.
%
% A configuration is [man, wolf, goat, cabbage], where each item is on the west
% bank w or east bank e.  The recursive search keeps a visited list so eyeprolog
% explores the finite state space without looping.

% Output declarations: host-supplied goals select the relations written to this example's golden output.
%% goal: solution(X0, X1)

%% goal: solved(X0, X1)


% Program structure: facts set up the scenario, and rules derive the queried conclusions.

% Derivation rules: each rule below contributes one logical step toward the displayed results.
