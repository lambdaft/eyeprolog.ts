% Complex numbers, adapted from Eyeling complex.n3.
%
% Complex values are represented as two-item lists [Real, Imaginary], matching
% the pair-shaped pair lists used by the Eyeling source.

% Output declarations: host-supplied goals select the relations written to this example's golden output.
%
% The example derives arithmetic identities, polar conversions, powers, roots,
% exponential/trigonometric functions, and distance/normalization results from
% a small complex-number toolkit.

% Program structure: facts set up the scenario, and rules derive the queried conclusions.
pi(3.141592653589793).
e(2.718281828459045).

% Derivation rules: each rule below contributes one logical step toward the displayed results.
% z^w is evaluated through polar/log form, exposing useful intermediate proof steps.
